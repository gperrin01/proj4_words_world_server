This is the server-side of my final project of my course at General Assembly. 
[Currently running live on Heroku] (https://words-of-the-world.herokuapp.com/); it will take a few seconds to load as client and server are hosted on  separate Heroku projects.

[Please visit the client-side repo here] (https://github.com/gperrin01/ga_proj4_words_of_world) for the full Readme and all info on the project.
